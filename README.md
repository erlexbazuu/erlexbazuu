- ⚡ Fun fact: ...The first computer programmer was Ada Lovelace, a mathematician who lived in the 19th century. She is credited with writing the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine, which was designed for Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her work laid the foundation for modern computer programming, and the programming language Ada is named in her honor.
